**Abstract** : Phenology and especially reproductive timing is crucial for fruit tree species as yield and fruit quality are directly linked to an adequate flower development. In sweet cherry, flowering process is induced by specific chill and heat requirements. As temperatures become milder, this process is disrupted. Two intraspecific F1 mapping progenies, Regina × Lapins (R×L) and Regina × Garnet (R×G), were genotyped using the 6K cherry chip SNP developed in the RosBREED project. For the detection of quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling chilling requirements, the R×G progeny was evaluated during 3 years. For QTL controlling flowering date the two progenies were evaluated during 5 years. QTL analyses were performed separately for each year and combined for all years together. For chilling requirements, QTLs were detected on linkage groups (LG) 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Whereas for flowering date, QTLs were detected on all LGs. For both traits, a major QTL was detected on LG4 for each year of evaluation. Candidate genes were identified by combining functional annotation of the peach genome and QTLs’ localisation for bothtraits. Functional studies using RNAseq and qRT‐PCR are in progress to select the most promising candidate genes. Our results provide a basis for the identification of genes involved in chilling requirements and flowering date that could be used to develop cultivar ideotypes adapted to future climatic conditions.
