I am a junior research at Inra Bordeaux-Aquitaine (France), in the UMR1332 Biologie du Fruit et Pathologie laboratory. 

I study the adaptation of cherry tree to climate change through modelling. I integrate large datasets of climatic, phenotypic and genomic data into a descriptive and predictive model of the phenological stages of cherry tree, with the ultimate aim of selecting the right plant material adapted to adverse wheather conditions with guaranteed fruit quality.
